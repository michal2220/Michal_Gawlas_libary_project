# Michal_Gawlas_libary_project
Example app for library service

This project was created by me to practice building REST APIs

In this project I'm using Spring and Hibernate. Also I'm using Lombok plugin.

Under directory ERD Diagram You can find png file containing mentione ERD Diagram for this app, which outlines entity relations.

Biggest emphasis i put in RentController, as it is containg main functionality of this project.


I hope this brief summary will provide a better understanding of the origins of this project and why it is in its current form.
I created it as part of an exercise, so I haven't completed all the methods of controllers, such as the method responsible for book borrowing.
